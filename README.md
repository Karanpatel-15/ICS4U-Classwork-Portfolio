# üåê 2019 ICS4U Portfolio

As apart of my grade 11 Computer Class we had to create a showcase website using HTML/CSS (hosted on GitHub-Pages) for all our JS project completed in the class.<br /><br />
These projects include basic JS animations, Natural simulations using physics and OOP, Intro into SQL, etc.  <br /><br />
